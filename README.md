# ViewshedCalculator
Python script for generating viewsheds across coastal transects

The goal is to be able to draw a line in ArcGIS Pro, and feed the line shape to the script so
that it generates a viewshed for continous points along the line. 

Potentially, the user will have the option to combine the linear viewshed series into a single
shapefile, or to leave it as a series of individual viewsheds so that several points can be 
chosen for single-point ground truthing.
